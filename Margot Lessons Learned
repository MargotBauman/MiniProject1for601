I enjoyed working with Kent Pei on this project. Since high school, when working on group projects, I have often been the person doing the lion's share of the work.
That was not the case this time. I did set up the github repo, a trello board (that we didn't end up using), and a slack channel (which we did use).
However, I had never built an app, used an api, or even thought about either of those. Moreover, I didn't realize there was sample python code
on the class google docs until well into the project. Needless to say, I would have found this project stressful even without the added complication of changing to a
new laptop running a relatively unfamilar OS (I've been an Apple girl since 1979, and I needed a Windows laptop for a different project, so I reashly decided to just
use the Windows laptop for all of my school-related work. This was not a wise choice, at least for this project.) Fortunately for me, Kent really picked up alot of the
slack, and by the time he ran into issues, I had learned enough about the new system to be able to contribute to the refinements of the project.

Therefore, lesson 1 for me is don't try to learn six new things all at once. One at a time works better. 

I have also learned that I perhaps judged my former group work partners too harshly in the past. I am caring this lesson into the Main Project, as neither
of my partners have extensive experience with Verilog, and hadn't ever thought about Trusted Execution Environments before now. I am trying very hard to 
provide them both with adequate resources to bring them up to speed without overwhelming them with unnecessary or premature information.

As I am a very visual learner, I also appreciated the ability to refer to other groups' code to help me see where I/we was/were going wrong. 

I regret that I was not able to be a better participant in the project work from the outset.
