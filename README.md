user stories brainstormed with Pei on 9/9/19:
1) I, a company, want to know what my customers think of my products/services.
2) I, a busy person, want to keep up with my friends (the accounts I follow) but do not have the time to look at everything.
3) I, a student, want to know what my favorite celebrities are up to.
4) I, a student, want to know where to find the best clubs/restaurants/etc in my college's town or city.
5) I, a visitor, wnat to know what the best tourist attractions/accommodations/services/etc are for me in the town/city I am visiting.
5a) I, a town/city, want to track where visitors go, so that no attraction gets overcrowded/overwhelmed.
5b) I, an attraction/accommodation/services company in a town/city, want to know what my visitors think of my company.

Will probably start with user story 5, as it allows for expansion to 5a and 5b quite readily.
